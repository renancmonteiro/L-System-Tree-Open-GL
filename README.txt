L-Systems

Implemented in using Visual Studio 2010 using C++ with OPEN GL.

Fractals are useful way of approaching to infinity and for drawing some 
real life like objects where same pattern recurs. To do so, we are drawing 
single line and then recurring sub trees.

Recursive definition of such trees might be,
A tree is a line from root point to tree top point followed by two sub-trees,
each having the root at the top of parent tree and own top at new calculated point.
